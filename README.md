For CSE 110 SP24, Professor Powell's Software Engineering. This lab aims to focus on Git/Markdown and setting up a dev environment for the Software Engineering Course.

This marks the beginning of Spring Quarter's Software Engineering Curriculum. Furthur ahead I have to continue to learn relevant tools such as HTML/CSS/JS and any other frameworks that may be necessary for the project. I also have to continue to iterate on my personal website and develop competence in the field of software engineering.
